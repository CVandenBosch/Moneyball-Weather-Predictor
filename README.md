# Moneyball-Weather-Project

## Description
The *Moneyball Weather Project* is a program written in Python I created for my *Intro to Computer Science* class at Clark University. It gives personalized clothing recommendations based on the day's weather and learns from user feedback over time.
- Morning: The program suggests clothing (ex, raincoat if it's raining, shorts and a t-shirt if it's hot).
- Evening: The program asks how comfortable the user felt with the morning's recommendation. Based on the feedback, it adjusts its internal temperature ranges to improve future advice.
This project was an opportunity to practice object-oriented programming while exploring adaptive logic and learning how to develop a project.

## Features
- Terminal interface
- Two-phase design: morning recommendation + evening feedback
- Personalization: system adapts to the user's comfort preferences over time
- Object-oriented structure: implemented with two classes representing morning and evening routines
- Simple, single-file Python implementation

## Future Improvements
It has been over two years since Dylan and I first built this project in our Intro to Computer Science course, and both of us have grown significantly as programmers since then. We would love to revisit and expand on this project with new features, such as:
- Integrating a closet system where users can log their clothing items so the program can recommend complete outfits, not just generic suggestions.
- Enhancing personalization with machine learning techniques to better adapt recommendations.
- Expanding the interface beyond the terminal (e.g., simple GUI or web app).
These improvements would transform the project from a simple class exercise into a practical, real-world tool.
